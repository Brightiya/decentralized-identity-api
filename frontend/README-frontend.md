# Frontend (Angular) README

This directory is intended to hold an Angular 17 app that integrates with the backend API.

Suggested steps:

1. `cd frontend`
2. `yarn start`
3. Add services to call `/api/profile`, `/api/did`, `/api/vc`
4. Use ethers.js for wallet connect and reading on-chain profile data.

This repo intentionally ships only a scaffold because frontend details vary by choice.
